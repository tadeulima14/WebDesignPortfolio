          <figcaption>After the modeling was done,
            I moved to UV wrapping, so I could adjust the multiple textures. 
            After texturing I had to figure out a rig for all the moving parts. The armature was easy enough, 
            but the most challenging part of this project was getting the tracks to work.</figcaption>

                Wall-e rigged model,

                the body, arms, eyes, suspension and tracks.

          <figcaption>I used constraints to lock the rotation to the X axis and transfer any 
            Y movement data to the X axis so the tracks rotated accurately.
            Before using constrainsts moving 
            Walle would caused my track assembly to break and distort</figcaption>

          <figcaption>The corrugated metal was hard to align properly on

                On this project I modeled a Junkers G38 for an animation. 
                I only rigged the ailerons, elevator, and rudder
             so it was a simple rig overall but I learned a lot 
             about uv wrapping and texturing during this project.

          <figcaption>The procedural texture is based off a 
            wave texture, to create stripes and I used a 
            displacement node to lower the edges of the stripes
             and raise the center face area to give a ridged metal
             effect.</figcaption>

                I assigned a boolean function to a cube so that it would "eat" 
                another mesh when that assigned mesh was passed through the
                cube. I assigned the logo to be the target then placed the 
                cube over it and animated the cube slowly moving down the X 
                axis. With this I achieved an effect of text being slowly 
                sprayed on a wall.</figcaption>

            <figcaption> Graffiti logo. 
                For this project my client wanted his logo to be 
                spray painted on a wall. The paint can had to create a 
                smoke effect that could be blown away by the wind at the 
                end of the spraying, revealing the logo beneath. This propject
                had many different simulation effects and was another 
                valuable learning experience for me.

                After this I modeled a paint can and 
                attached a smoke simulation to the nozzle to achieve my smoke
                fx. Adding a force field to move the smoke was the final step
