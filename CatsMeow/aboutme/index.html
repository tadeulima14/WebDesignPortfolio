          Hey! I’m Kiana and I absolutely love being a waxer!!! 
          I went to school to become an Aesthetician specifically to do waxing in 2010.
          I loved learning all the subjects and procedures to do with aesthetics but 
          waxing definitely still is my favorite thing to do. 
          I offer full body speed waxing, specializing in Brazilians. I pride myself in doing everything
          in my power to offer a safe space for everyone, of any size, gender, and body type. I understand that especially with intimate waxing 
          that getting undressed and exposing yourself in front of a stranger may be nerve wracking, but 
          I will assure you, that I too have been the client on the table before, scared and second guessing if I made the right decision to pay
          someone remove my body hair? And guess what?? It was the best decision I ever made! I loved it so much that when I decided to change careers
          there wasn't a second thought that I would pursue becoming a waxer. So, I treat every client exactly how I would like treated and also given a 
          thorough wax- exactly how I would like to be waxed. My goal is to for you to become as comfortable with me and the procedure as possible.
          I'll be your biggest hype girl, cheer you on, or back you up if someone has got you down. I always thought of my own personal waxing sessions as 
          a cheaper version of a therapy appt while venting with my waxers. Ha! Let me be that for you. I am always up for more friends.     
          All are welcome in this safe space! No body shaming or judgement EVER! 
          Waxing is a lifestyle and a personal journey. I have heard horror stories from people who have had horrible waxing experiences. 
          Let me change that if you have been one of the unlucky ones. Communication is key, so please speak up. If you are booking your first wax, please put that in the notes.
          I will take my time and explain throughout the procedure what I am doing, what is about to be done, and why I am doing it. I come from a medical background so this is my norm. 
          I already give myself this extra time in my schedule with every appt, 
          especially first-time clients. You Are Never a Number to me like how some wax chains treat their clients, more like an assembly line. 
          Body hair can be a very sensitive issues for some, riddled with shame due from others or embarrassment. I want you to have a new experience.  
          When clients say that wasn't as bad as I was expecting, I know I did my job correctly. 
          It is a great feeling seeing a client who is instantly happy from 
          having their unwanted hair gone and walking out of the salon feeling like a new person.
          Let me help you to be hair free in the style you prefer.

        <p class="info">
          I am also a Certified Make Up Artist. I have been a professional Belly Dancer for 25 years, I got tired of having to pay for 
          others to fine tune my stage make up so I went to a make-up academy. I did work as a make-up artist on photoshoots, events, and weddings for years, 
          though I have hung up those brushes long ago.
          But my understanding of how important it is for one’s lashes or brows to pop, I do offer a few beauty aesthetics treatments. 
          These services offered are 
          Lash Tints & Lifts, and Brow Tint/Stains.
          And if Hyperpigmentation has got you down, I got you covered! 
          I offer special skin brightening treatments and at home products by the wonderful company - Bryght to tackle any areas of the external skin that bothers you.
          Who needs therapy when you can chat? 
          it up with me while having your personal grooming needs helped too?
          I try to make every appointment entertaining and enjoyable especially for waxing because having
          your hair ripped out is so much fun (not), so I'll crack jokes and keep you distracted.
          My room is located inside the Golden Hands Salon by appointment only. 
          If you need a certain time not offered, e.g., 7am, 
          please let me know and I’ll try to be as accommodating as 
          possible to both our schedules.
